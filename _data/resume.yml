#     Richard hails from Tulsa.
#     He has earned degrees from the University of Oklahoma and Stanford. (Go Sooners and Cardinals!)
#     Before starting Pied Piper, he worked for Hooli as a part time software developer.
#     While his work focuses on applied information theory,
#     mostly optimizing lossless compression schema of both the length-limited and adaptive variants,
#     his non-work interests range widely,
#     everything from quantum computing to chaos theory.
#     He could tell you about it, but THAT would NOT be a “length-limited” conversation!
