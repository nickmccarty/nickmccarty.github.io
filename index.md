# Thank You
Thank you for visiting my site!

The side menu can be used to access my "blog," my resume, and my portfolio.

If you get the sense that I may be a potential resource for your project, team, or company, please feel free to contact me.

<!---## First Steps
Please start by reading the [Documentation]{:.heading.flip-title}.
Specifically, the chapters below should be relevant now:

* [Install]{:.heading.flip-title} --- How to install and run Hydejack.
* [Upgrade]{:.heading.flip-title} --- You can skip this if you haven't used Hydejack before.
* [Config]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Once Jekyll is running you can start with basic configuration.
