Designed and managed project workflows involving large datasets in the production of 3D models for architects and engineers, and having freelanced as a data analyst serving the nonprofit sector, I have paid particular attention to systematization and automation wherever possible. As an independent quantitative currency trader, I have had the opportunity to take the (semi-)automation of my work to the next level. My aim here is to share with you the techniques and systems I employ, and to engage in meaningful dialogue about quantitative analysis with regards to our respective domains. 

### My Wheelhouse

The tools I rely upon to do my work include:

- Python

	- Numpy
    - Pandas
    - Matplotlib
    - Scikit-Learn
    
- Jupyter Notebook

With these open source resources, I have been able to conduct econometric and technical analysis, testing of automated trading strategies, and trading in the forex market without having to devote undue screen time to trading platforms. However, regardless of domain, my belief is that we stand to improve as practitioners of data science through discourse--so please feel free to reach out!
